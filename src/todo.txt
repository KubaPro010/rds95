Current TODO for RDS encoding:
- UECP Decoding
- Dynamic PS (may not be implemented)
- Bidirectionality

ASCII commands to implement:
- Group sequence
- Short RT

ASCII Group seqeunce:
0 - Four 0As (PS x 4)
1 - 1A (ECC/LIC, PIN)
2 - 2A (RT)
A - 10A (PTYN)
E - 14A 14B (EON, yet to implement)
X - UDG1 (yet to implement, max 8 groups per udg)
Y - UDG2 (yet to implement)
R - RT+ 3A 11A (do i switch between them like ecc lic?)
F - 15A (LPS)
Max 24 items in a sequence.

Note that most of this is takes out of pira.cz's P164 RDS Encoder's manual: https://pira.cz/rds/p164man.pdf

I plan for this's commands to be similiar to PIRA32's or P164's (both are made by pira.cz)

In theory, now you can use the MiniRDS as a PIRA32 type device in Magic RDS 4 (but not everything is supported)
