Pydemod
-------

Pydemod is a set of Python libraries and tools for demodulating radio signals. It does not intend to compete with full-featured packages such as GNU Radio. Instead, it strives to allow radio enthusiasts to gain hands-on experience with modulation schemes.

Pydemod relies on [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)/[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/).
